# Pop Hextychs Twitter Bot

This bot is set up to do the following:

1. Query Flickr for Creative Commons and Public Domain images matching tags like "celebrity," "portrait", "object", etc.
2. Download a randomly selected image from the search result
3. Process the image into six Andy Warhol-style screenprints in different colors
4. Assemble all six into one image
5. Tweet the results

The source code is here in this repository, so you can build your own clones, submit pull requests, and learn from it to build your own ImageMagick bots and Twitter things!
